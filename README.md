# sample_app

This app was originally an educational app developed during my student project. I have reworked the app so that the app can be used as a kind of sample app. 

## Features

- **Firebase:** The app is connected to Firebase. The sample app uses the Authentication function here. You can either register with a fantasy email and a 6-digit password or use these login details: 
  - E-Mail: sample@app.de
  - Password: 123456
- Using templates in Firebase, you can also reset the password in the app via your email.

- **Folder structure:** For sorting individual lectures and homework tasks, which can be structured by topic
